      <span className="dropcap">W</span>hen I was young, my mum and dad died and I never got a chance to live
       with any of them, I grew up in the family which could not provide enough for all of us because we
       were many as an extended family
      So, we had to cater for ourselves in order to go to school with something in our stomachs
      When I got lunch we didn’t manage to get supper and either way, but with that entire struggle
       and everything, we never gave up and God never forgot or even forsaken us, me and my cousins.
      By the fact that I knew how it feels to have nothing at all, I was inspired to start up this
      organization “WNIS” to bring hope and extend love to people in a similar condition I was in back
      then or even worse.
     WNIS does that today, will do it tomorrow and forever.  &quot;doing little things out of love&quot;

      so, by the fact that I serve with fellow youths and we do the little we can do, am inspired to help even more needy people
      May God be our protector and provider in whatever project we do and willing to do
     i love WNIS because they say yes to the unknown and am learning that too
    Long live WNIS, We Need It Still.</p>

      <p><span className="dropcap">I</span> love so much to help others in need, that’s because a lot has
      happened in my life and I have met a lot of kind people who have helped me  so, I wish to be the
      same person to so many other people’s lives out there who can’t access whatever they need in order
      to be happy.
      WNIS inspired me to exercise and practice this at a wide range and that’s why I joined this
      organization, I know am not the richest person n I dont have everything but I know the feeling when
      you have nothing, that’s why I do the little I can do.
      At WNIS we do little things out of love and forever.</p>

      <span className="dropcap">I</span> was raised up in an extended family with my Aunt Nabasitu Harriet as
      the head of the family, she passed on (may she Rest In Peace).
      My mum and dad died when I was still young so I was taken up by my aunt
      My aunt was a very loving caring lady who taught me how to love unconditional, she used to help
      other children that were homeless and she gave them hope by bringing them home and paying them school
      fees. This special kind heart of this inspired me a lot to have a heart for others and I take the initiative
      of helping those in need with the little I can do and offer
      My aunt is one of the reasons I joined WNIS to extend love to a wider group of the less fortunate, its the
      core value of us at WNIS.
      May her soul rest in peace

      we are all equal
      The love to give back to the community gives high inspiration to be at this organization
      I myself love a lot doing charity to help the less fortunate; this is how I get to see my God/ Allah
      through these people
      I feel happy always when I am among the reasons why someone is smiling on a particular day
      Thanks to WNIS for the amazing opportunity given to me as a youth to be at service to Gods people
